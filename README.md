# âš¡ **Currently Working on**

[Project FPS](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/ProjectFPS) - An Unreal, C++ and Blueprint first-person shooter that I am developing. The unnamed project will be a rip of Valorant and CS:GO tactical shooter-like game. However, it will not be a 5v5 similar to its inspirations. It will be a Player-vs-Environment, where players must clear levels to complete the game.

[WoodInGraphics](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/WoodInGraphics) - An OpenGL Rendering project developed using C++, GLFW, GLM and GLSL. I love computer graphics and wanted to learn more about programming the pipeline and utilizing shaders to create optimal and beautfil graphics within games.

[CodingChallengeSolutions](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/CodingChallengeSolutions) - This is a consolidation of all the answers for Coding Challenges that I have complete over time. This includes multiple files for every language I complete them in. (C++, C#, JavaScript and Python)

[UltimateTicTacToe](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/UltimateTicTacToe) - A C++ project that creates a text-based version of a a classic game every child knows. Tic Tac Toe. However, instead of your regulars 3x3 grid, each grid spot is populated with a another 3x3 grid within it. The goal of the game is you win the bigger 3x3 grid by winning the smaller 3x3 grid within.
