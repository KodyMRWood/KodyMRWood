# ⚡ **Currently Working on**

🔫[Project FPS](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/ProjectFPS) - An Unreal, C++ and Blueprint first-person shooter that I am developing. The unnamed project will have shooting mechanics similar to tactical shooter-like games like Valorant and CS:GO. However, it will not be a 5v5 like its inspirations. It will be a Player-vs-Environment (PvE), where players must clear levels to complete the game.

🖥️[WoodInGraphics](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/WoodInGraphics) - An OpenGL Rendering project developed using C++,  GLSL, GLFW and GLM. I love computer graphics and wanted to learn more about programming the rendering pipeline and utilizing shaders to create optimal and beautiful graphics within games.

⌨️[CodingChallengeSolutions](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/CodingChallengeSolutions) - This is a consolidation of all the answers for Coding Challenges that I have complete over time. This includes multiple files for every language I complete them in. (C++, C#, JavaScript and Python). This project is the help me learn and hone my understanding of data structures and algorithms for multiple languages.

❌🔴[UltimateTicTacToe](https://github.com/KodyMRWood/UltimateTicTacToe) - A C++ project that creates a text-based version of a a classic game every child knows. Tic Tac Toe. However, instead of your regulars 3x3 grid, each grid spot is populated with a another 3x3 grid within it. The goal of the game is you win the bigger 3x3 grid by winning the smaller 3x3 grid within. The goal of this project is to learn more about C++ and utilizing data structures and popular libraries such as iostream.
